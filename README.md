# Project Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! On the page you will find information about me, my skills and the projects I've worked on.

## Purpose

This portfolio is a central place to present my projects and skills to potential employers and collaborators. This page itself is my first project to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, BEM, SCSS and Git.

## Summary

- Established a public repository on GitHub for the portfolio project.

- Implemented SCSS (Sass) for styling throughout the project.

- Adhered to the B.E.M (Block Element Modifier) naming convention for CSS classes.

- Ensured full responsiveness across all screen widths using CSS Grid and Flexbox where appropriate.

- Designed and developed sections within the portfolio
